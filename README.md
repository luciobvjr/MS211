#### Numerical Calculus subject from UNICAMP using python as programming language
### - Floating point
**floating-point.py** deal with matrix operations and conversions to floating point. More specifically FP(10,3,-9,9), The number is presented on base 10, 3 decimal places, from -9 to 9.
### - Bissection
**bissection.py** uses the bissection method to find the interception of the function `h = xË†3 - 3.5x` with de abcissa axis.
- input: Upper and lower limits, accuracy
- input: Upper and lower limits, accuracy
### - False position (Regula Falsi)
**false-position.py** is similar to the bissection, the only difference is the numerical method used to solve the problem.
### - Euler Methods
Inside the **euler-methods** folder you can find 2 exercises with these methods, the names of the files related to the second exercise end with the number 2. The methods are used to solve ODEs (Ordinary Differencial Equations)
- input: step size (h), and target x value
- output: Corresponding y value
